    "In this third task I implemented better weight initialization, an improved sigmoid and finally gradient momentum. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Improved weight initialization: as we can see in the plot the gaussian distributed weights gave quite better results. We can notice that the validation seems to stabilize around 10000 training steps instead of still improving around 30000 as in task 2c. Also its seems like the weights converged to a little bit better result, more accurate classification. We reached 95% accuracy in ~5000 repetitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Improved sigmoid: also here the convergence speed seemed to improved quite significantly. Now we reached 95% accuracy in ~2000 repetitions compared to ~5000 repetitions in the previous subtask. Though, the overall accuracy does not seems to improve that much.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Momentum: the momentum further more improvec the convergence speed. Now we reached 95% accuracy in ~1000 repetitions, around half the repetitions from the previous task. Also here the final accuracy does not seem to improve. Almost the opposite, which kind of makes sense since we are not only using the correct gradient. This also gives a jumpy behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally all of these 3 we still have tendecies of overfitting. This is though more likely because of the number of hidden layers / nodes in the hidden layer in this case. "
